            Halo 2 is a 2004 first-person shooter game developed by Bungie and published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox console. 
            Halo 2 is the second installment in the Halo franchise and the sequel to 2001's critically acclaimed Halo: Combat Evolved.
            In Halo 2's story mode, the player assumes the roles of the human Master Chief and, occasionally, an extra-terrestrial called 
            the Arbiter in a 26th-century conflict between the United Nations Space Command, the genocidal Covenant, and the parasitic Flood.

            As I have previously stated in the "About Me" section of my website I have been playing videogames since I was around 4-5 years old.
            My love for videogames is so great I decided that I should have a whole page dedicated to the topic. I started playing videogames
            when my uncle gave me his old original Xbox, the big box looking console, with a copy of Halo 2. I quickly fell in love with the 
            gameplay, universe, and story that the game, and many others I played afterwards, had to offer. It sucked me in and I never looked back.
            At the time, and still to this day, I thought of gaming as a means to just simply have fun and make new friends. However, as I grew older,
            I began to look at games through a different lense and really started to appreciate the storytelling, the environments, the coding of 
            the gameplay mechanics and so on. It is because of this love that I have deicded to take up programming so that, hopefully, in the future 
            I can create new games and capture that same mystic ism for other kids and adults alike that I had growing up. Videogames will always be
            apart of who I am as a person.

            I have many many games that I have enjoyed throughout the years, so many that it was a little difficult coming up with this list. 
            There is no special criteria for what allows a game to be placed as one of my favorite videogames of all time. Videogames are like art,
            they are very subjective. You will find that there are many Triple A games that I love, but just as many indie games on this list as well.
            That being said, here are my favorite games of all time: 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> The entire Halo franchise of games </li>
            <li> Red Dead Redemption 2 </li>
            <li> The Last of Us </li>
            <li> Minecraft </li>
            <li> Many, but not all, of the Call of Duty franchise </li>
            <li> Escape from Tarkov </li>
            <li> Terraria </li>
            <li> Hollow Knight </li>
            <li> The Dark Souls franchise </li>
            <li> DayZ </li>
