              <strong> Fishing: </strong> I typically do a lot of fishing,
              especially come Spring time and most of the time all throughout
              summer as well. Most of the time I do freshwater fishing in ponds
              and lakes, but every now and then I like to go salt water fishing
              on the coast with my brother or a couple of my buddies. We always
              have a good time whether we catch any fish or not!

              <strong> Driving: </strong> Believe it or not, I actually really
              enjoy driving/riding around town and taking in the local sights.
              Typically my girlfriend and I will just hop in the car, mostly at
              night when theres no traffic, and just see what we can see or do.
              Our favorite places to ride around are Hattiesburg, Ocean Springs,
              and even further away places like Florida or Alabama beaches such
              as Pensacola or Orange Beach. There are always new and interesting
              places and activities to do if you just look a little harder than
              usual!

              <strong> Skating or Hiking: </strong> A few summers ago I decided
              to pick up skateboarding as a small hobby to keep my active, and I
              never looked back. Since then, I have made an effort to skate
              around twice a week during the Summer months, sometimes even more
              than that. I also really enjoy hiking for a lot of the reasons
              that I enjoy riding around town, there are just so many sights to
              see and it can be very peaceful and thereputic. There aren't many
              hiking areas in the surrounding cities so I typically hike through
              some of the coastal trails in Ocean Springs.

              <strong> Gaming: </strong> This is one of my most enjoyed and
              time-involved hobby of mine. I have been playing games since I was
              5 years old, with my first game ever being Halo 2 followed closely
              by the Pokemon series of games. There are always new games
              releasing that are just as interesting as the next with great
              storytelling and intriguing gameplay; I like to think of the video
              games that I play more as books:) I am sure that I will continue
              to keep playing games in the future and hopefully create my own
              game from scratch using the Coding knowledge I have learned
              throughout my years in this program!

              <strong> Collecting/Tinkering: </strong> Something to go along
              with my enjoyment for gaming would be my collection of retro
              games, and hopefully retro game systems in the future. I have a
              strong attatchment to older video games and systems along with the
              history of games in general, things like that just really intrigue
              me. It is because of this facination that I have also developed a
              love for tinkering with these systems and fixing broken and old
              systems and game cartridges. I have also built two personal
              computers over the last 5 years or so and overall it has given me
              a very strong interest in the field of electronics.
