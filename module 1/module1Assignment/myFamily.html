          My immediate family consists of just my mom and my brother, which are
          the two people I am closest to in my entire family. My mom is a very
          funny, outgoing, and very caring individual who has always provided me
          with countless laughs and motivation throughout all my hard years in
          school and any other activity I become interested in. She is my rock
          and the person I can always turn to for advice and I love her more
          than she probably realized (she gets on to me a lot!).
          <br />
          Of course, I can't talk about just my mom when my brother is just as
          close to me. He may get on my nerves sometimes, well he gets on my
          nerves a lot really, but despite that he has become my absolute best
          friend. We pretty much do everything together such as fishing or
          gaming and even go to Walmart or the grocery store together for our
          mom! He's such a character and always makes me and everyone laugh and
          he has a very big heart, I love him to death and I know he will always
          be right there by my side!
        </p>
        <footer style="font-style: italic">
          My immediate family is my ride or die!

      <section>
        <header><h2>Other, Close Family...</h2></header>
        <hr style="width: 100%; height: 1px; background-color: black" />
        <p style="font-size: 12pt">
          The most important individuals of my the rest of my family are
          definetely my grandparents. Despite their old age, they still manage
          to come across with youthful exhuberance the majority of the time. My
          grandfather has easily been one of the most admired people in my life
          in the ways that he is always trying to help others in any way he can
          and through his amazing work ethic, which I still try to replicate
          myself. My grandmother, unlike my grandfather who is usually pretty
          stern, is super laid-back and always in a funny or joking mood to
          which she always keeps me laughing with her jokes or her pretty
          unusual stories that she likes to tell me of her youth. I love both of
          them more than anything as they have been one of the biggest helps in
          my life.
          <br />
          Lastly, but not least, would be my uncle. My uncle has been one of my
          bestfriends, despite being my uncle, since the day I was born (we were
          born one day apart). He has probably been the closest thing I have had
          to a father figure in my life and he has never taught me wrong and I
          would trust him with my life. He is super funny and very energetic and
          we are always getting into some stuff from time to time. We share a
          lot of the same hobbies and I think that helps us make a much stronger
          connection. I love him with all my heart just as I know he does with
          me.

          Just because they are my "other" family doesn't mean I love them any
          less!
