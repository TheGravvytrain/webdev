            Hello, my name is Carson Grey Chapman. I am currently enrolled in the Coding Program at the Forrest County Campus for PRCC.
            I suppose I would describe myself as a pretty outgoing person who is always willing to explore and try new things or innovations.
            I, of course, am an aspiring coder who hopes to create, redesign, or simply tinker with new and old websites or applications alike.
            There are many things and hobbies that I enjoy doing such as playing games, fishing, shooting, riding around new areas, etc.
            with which I will elaborate more on my hobbies page you can find down below.
            <br>
            <br>
            As I am still a young adult, 21 to be exact, I have a very optimistic outlook on life, especially in the work field.
            I am currently employed at my family business The Oil Exchange located in Petal, MS where I am able to amass a decent amount
            of funds to aid in school and my other silly hobbies. I am very close to all of my friends that I have all met throughout my time
            here on campus and we regularly hang out or play video games together. Of course, I am always meeting new people, making new friends,
            and creating new connections with my fellow students and instructors.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would definetley consider myself a family man, meaning I am very in touch with nearly every person in my immediate family. However, 
            my brother is probably the most important person to me and largely my best friend, even though there is a slight age gap (he's 15).
            We do pretty much everything together including playing games together, fishing, and getting in trouble alot with our mom! There are several
            other family members with whom I am close too such as my mom, uncle, and grandparents, but I will elaborate on them later on in another webpage.
