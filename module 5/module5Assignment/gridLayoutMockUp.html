                Hello, my name is Carson Grey Chapman. I am currently enrolled in the
                Coding Program at the Forrest County Campus for PRCC. I suppose I would
                describe myself as a pretty outgoing person who is always willing to
                explore and try new things or innovations. I, of course, am an <span style="font-style: oblique;"> aspiring
                coder </span> who hopes to create, redesign, or simply tinker with new and old
                websites or applications alike. There are many things and hobbies that I
                enjoy doing such as playing games, fishing, tinkering/fixing things,
                riding around new areas, etc. with which I will elaborate more on my
                hobbies page you can find down below.
                <br />
                <br />
                As I am still a young adult, <strong> 21 to be exact </strong>, I have a very optimistic
                outlook on life, especially in the work field. I am currently employed
                at my family business The Oil Exchange located in Petal, MS where I am
                able to amass a decent amount of funds to aid in school and my other
                silly hobbies. I am very close to all of my friends that I have all met
                throughout my time here on campus and we regularly hang out or play
                video games together. Of course, I am always meeting new people, making
                new friends, and creating new connections with my fellow students and
                instructors.
                <br />
                <br />
                I would <span style="font-style: italic;"> definetley </span> consider myself a family man, meaning I am very in
                touch with nearly every person in my immediate family. However, my
                brother is probably the most important person to me and largely my best
                friend, even though there is a slight age gap (he's 15). We do pretty
                much everything together including playing games together, fishing, and
                getting in trouble alot with our mom! There are several other family
                members with whom I am close too such as my mom, uncle, and
                grandparents, but I will elaborate on them later on in another webpage.

                    This is only a mock-up of my actual homepage in order to really get
                    a feel for the grid layout and to see if it would suit my main page.
                    To be honest, I am not exactly feeling it, though I can see where its
                    strengths lie. However, I am pretty happy with the result and see myself
                    using this layout in the future.
