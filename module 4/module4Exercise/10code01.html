    <div id="d4">DIV #4: I used a variety of different margins and margin measurements to accomplish this assignment! 
      It is kind of tricky and a little annoying to be honest trying to get each box pixel perfect but I always persevere!
      Hopefully we will learn of a much better way to do this task soon.</div>
    <div id="d5">DIV #5</div>
    <div id="d6">DIV #6: In addition to all of the margins and padding I added to these squares, I also used some different border colors, sizes, and types!
      Fortunately, the borders were much easier to figure out than margins and padding:)
