      Championship Saturday night at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex.

      "Words can't even describe how proud I am of the girls," Pearl River coach
      Sarah Smith said. "The team executed so well, not once but twice; in the
      most high-pressure situation that you can imagine. These girls are
      exceptional athletes. They are relentless in their daily pursuit of
      perfection, and it absolutely set them apart on the nationals floor.
    </p>

    <p>
      "The key to our victory was strong veteran leadership, focused athletes
      and high standards for all of our skills."
