        Hello, my name is Carson Grey Chapman. I am currently enrolled in the
        Coding Program at the Forrest County Campus for PRCC. I suppose I would
        describe myself as a pretty outgoing person who is always willing to
        explore and try new things or innovations. I, of course, am an <span style="font-style: oblique;"> aspiring
        coder </span> who hopes to create, redesign, or simply tinker with new and old
        websites or applications alike. There are many things and hobbies that I
        enjoy doing such as playing games, fishing, tinkering/fixing things,
        riding around new areas, etc. with which I will elaborate more on my
        hobbies page you can find down below.
        <br />
        As I am still a young adult, <strong> 21 to be exact </strong>, I have a very optimistic
        outlook on life, especially in the work field. I am currently employed
        at my family business The Oil Exchange located in Petal, MS where I am
        able to amass a decent amount of funds to aid in school and my other
        silly hobbies. I am very close to all of my friends that I have all met
        throughout my time here on campus and we regularly hang out or play
        video games together. Of course, I am always meeting new people, making
        new friends, and creating new connections with my fellow students and
        instructors.
        <br />
        <br />
        I would <span style="font-style: italic;"> definetley </span> consider myself a family man, meaning I am very in
        touch with nearly every person in my immediate family. However, my
        brother is probably the most important person to me and largely my best
        friend, even though there is a slight age gap (he's 15). We do pretty
        much everything together including playing games together, fishing, and
        getting in trouble alot with our mom! There are several other family
        members with whom I am close too such as my mom, uncle, and
        grandparents, but I will elaborate on them later on in another webpage.

        <aside class="rightAlignedAside"> 
          This is my content that I am supposed to align to the right side of the page.
          If I'm being completely honest, I'm not a fan of right aligning text in the slightest.
          I mean, centered text is super clean and left-align text just makes sense (we read from left to right).
          The only acceptable instance of right aligned text, in my opinion, is for an aside.
          Well, I guess I have to make sacrafices for that A+... heres your right aligned text as an aside.
